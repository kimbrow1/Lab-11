## Odd Duck


 During this project I built an app that displays three potential products side-by-side-by-side, without favoring any single product.This appâ€™s purpose is to have members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most interested in seeing as a new creation. I stored each anonymous vote, calculated totals, and visually displayed the results. In order to make the selection process more ideal for users  this app only allows 25 selections. The notion for this is to make sure that the team keeps up with the total number of clicks and percentage of the times each image was clicked.
